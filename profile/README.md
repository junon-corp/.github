Junon is the way to create 3D complex softwares, games and more. The project includes its own tools such as an engine and a GUI library.

In addition to English, we translate to French and (Brazilian) Portuguese.

The open-source projects related to Junon are all published in this organisation. Note that the programming language (projects [juc](https://github.com/junon-corp/juc) and [jup](https://github.com/junon-corp/jup)) is archived. It will come back later, as a simpler language for Junon.
